# 🎵 Music Player Project

This repository contains a **responsive music player** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as part of my **CodeAlpha Internship**. The player includes custom audio controls, rotating album art, and a visually appealing interface that adapts to different devices.

## 🚀 Features

- **Audio Playback**: Play/pause functionality, next/previous track navigation.
- **Rotating Album Art**: The album art rotates while the music plays.
- **Custom Controls**: Includes play/pause, volume, seek slider, and random/repeat options.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts smoothly to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on all devices.
- **Fixed Loader Animation**: Loader animation plays before the track starts and doesn't expand during playback.
- **Media Queries**: Ensures a seamless user experience across devices with responsive design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the web player.
- **CSS**: Adds styling, animations, and makes the design responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Manages audio playback, control interactions, and dynamic DOM manipulation.
